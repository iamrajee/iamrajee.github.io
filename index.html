		<br/>I'm a B.Tech. graduate from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Palakkad.
		I have a passionate interest in motion planning.
<!-- 		I'm passionate about vision-based robotics. -->
		I’m research-oriented, team player and looking forward to collaborate with an enthusiastic team or startup researching in this domain.
		I've participated in several robotics and ml competitions. I was the former head of Robotics Club, IIT Palakkad.
		My major projects are based on Swarm Robotics, Path planning, SLAM and Vision-based pick and place. 
		I am currently working on porting MTC to ROS2. My goal is to continue researching in the field of robotics and learn more along the way.
